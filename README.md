# Advanced Modular VGA Controller (AMVGA) 
 This report details the development of the Advanced Modular VGA Controller (AMVGA), a student-led project aimed at creating a versatile VGA controller system. The AMVGA system addresses limitations found in traditional VGA controllers by offering support for multiple display resolutions and embedded output options. It provides users with flexibility, allowing them to select from various resolutions, including 640x480 and 1920x1080, and choose preset embedded outputs. Key components of the project include the design and implementation of VGA controllers for 640x480 and 1920x1080 resolutions, alongside an output generator component. These controllers generate essential signals such as horizontal sync (HS) and vertical sync (VS) pulses while providing outputs for red, green, and blue (RGB) colors. Additionally, a selector component enables users to seamlessly switch between different outputs and preset functions and modes, enhancing system versatility. The AMVGA system underwent rigorous simulation and testing using the Vivado Design suite to evaluate its performance in accurately and efficiently driving VGA displays. The modular design approach facilitates easy integration of additional output blocks, enabling future expansion and customization. While the project does not aim for groundbreaking achievements, it serves as a valuable learning experience for students, providing insights into VGA controller technology and fostering skills in hardware design, VHDL programming, and FPGA implementation.
